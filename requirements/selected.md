For my prototype, I’m going to concentrate on the functional requirement of "search meals by name, ingredient, or category" and the non-functional requirement "easy to maintain and extend with new meal types or dietary restrictions." Firstly, there’s a reason that searching is what I chose to prototype. It’s a significant part of what users actually do to find something to cook, and it’s an easy way to showcase how this system actually works with only a little bit of sample data. Secondly, there’s obviously going to be expansion beyond what’s already been set up for SmartCater, and that’s why it’s so important that this prototype already looks clean and doesn’t turn into a mess later.

These two criteria complement each other quite naturally: where the logic for searching can conceived with a modular construction (thinking categories/tags or simple 'rules'), the addition of a new diet rule such as 'low carb' or a new category such as 'budget meals' will become a trivial modification rather than a whole new implementation of the feature. The implementation of the searching functionality also turns out to have a good scope for the prototype because it can certainly be completed within a simple CLI prototype: a set of meals with ingredients & categories, a couple of searching inputs, and output—enough to adequately demonstrate the concept without having to complete the ordering & delivery process.
